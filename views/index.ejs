<h2>About</h2>
	<p>Gig.it is a social networking app for musicians to meet one another and for bands to recruit members.</P>
<br>
	<p>This app was designed and built for my second project for the General Assembly Web Development Immersive course. For future implementations, I plan to build features that will allow for search and private messaging, as well as an improved edit form. Also, I plan to fully integrate the SoundCould API to provide an easy way for musicians to share their music.</p>
